I'm writing this guide for the ease of people that aren't me in creating a working
FTCLib-Pedro autonomous

### PRE REQS
Working teleop
FTCLib Command Base

### TUNING
Visit https://pedropathing.com/
Once you're done localizing and tuning, continue reading

### POSE FINDING
Run `PoseFinder.java` and drive your bot to each final position you want during auton. Then,
hit left bumper to save the Pose (x, y, heading) to your telemetry. Once you've found all your poses
for auton, screenshot or save your telemetry somewhere to add to your actual Auton.

### PATHING
Add your poses to `AutoPaths` enum and label groups at your convenience.

For Example

        PRELOAD(
                new Pose(0, 0, Math.toRadians(180)),
                new Pose(38, 6, Math.toRadians(180))
        ),

        GO_TO_SAMPLES(
                new Pose(38,  0, Math.toRadians(180)),
                new Pose(15, 0, Math.toRadians(180)),
                new Pose(15, -30, Math.toRadians(0)),
                new Pose(45, -30, Math.toRadians(0)),
                new Pose(45, -47, Math.toRadians(0))
        ),

Note: I use toRadians for my ease, but you can just straight add the heading number given by PoseFinder

### ACTIONS
Finally, add commands to your init for your auto actions. Make sure to use the `FollowPathCommand` with
your pose group enums. For all your actions besides drive, copy and paste your teleop code where you see fit.

            Command scorePreload =
                new SequentialCommandGroup(
                        new ParallelCommandGroup(
                                new SlideResetCommand(hSlide, hLimit),
                                new ServoCommand(outtakeClawDistRight, .8),
                                new ServoCommand(outtakeClawDistLeft, .2),
                                new ServoCommand(outtakeClawRot, 1),
                                new ServoCommand(outtakeClawTwist, Const.twist),
                                new SetPIDFSlideArmCommand(slide, 7750),
                                new FollowPathCommand(follower, AutoPaths.PRELOAD.line(follower), true)
                        ),
                        new ServoCommand(outtakeClaw, Const.release)
                );

            CommandScheduler.getInstance().schedule(
                scorePreload
            );

That's it, good luck for the season :)
