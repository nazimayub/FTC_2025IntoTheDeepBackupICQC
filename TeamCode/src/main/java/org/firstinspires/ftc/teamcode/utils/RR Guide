Below is a brief breakdown of the main points covered in the 1.0 Road Runner documentation on rr.brott.dev:
1. Installation
Instructions for installing the Road Runner library, dependencies, and integrating with a robot
control system.
2. New Features
Major Updates: Introduces improved calibration, dead wheel odometry, and unit-adjusted Ramsete
control.
Asymmetric Acceleration: The new ability to set separate limits for acceleration and
deceleration
Trajectory Improvements: Path continuity errors have been eliminated, enhancing the fluidity of
path generation
3. Migrating from 0.5.x
Simplified Package Structure: All classes have been moved into the root package for easier
navigation
Trajectory Sequences: Extended into an actions system, improving flexibility in managing servo
movements and motor powers
PID Controller Changes: Removal of some old classes like PIDFController, though they are still
accessible for use
4. Actions
Describes the new "actions" system for breaking down tasks into small steps that integrate well
with trajectory following, servo control, and other actions
5. API Docs
Technical documentation on all functions, constants, and methods provided by the Road Runner
library
6. Builder Reference
Trajectory Builder: Provides functions for building paths, including spline generation, turns,
and setting velocities
7. Variable Constraints
Custom Constraints: Explains how to override base velocity/acceleration constraints for specific
trajectory segments
